# Share-scrapper-V1

main_bot.py is used to extract historical NEPSE data from third party sites on a regular interval.
The Jupyter notebook (main_analysis.ipynb) located inside **Data Analysis folder** is built on top of it to analyze that data and help me make buy/sell decisions based on :
  1) Volume
  2) Bollinger Band Movements
  3) Tracking EMA signals
  4) Yearly High Low Proximity Measurements
  5) Fundamental Metrics such as EPS, Floating Shares etc. (this feature is still under construction)
